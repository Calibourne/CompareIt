This is a simple program was made for studying purposes only.
the program checks the content of 2 files that are provided to it
and displays whether they are identical or not.

Please note that there are 2 instances of the program:
1) An .exe instance (in the release folder) that is only compatible with windows os.
2) A .jar instance that is compatible with either windows or mac os.

* Special thanks to Amiga Yossy, Labai Lanna and Shamout Omar for testing the programs
* Aditional thanks to Labai Lanna for providing the guide for starting the .jar file on mac computers

If the .jar instance doesn't open please dowload Java SE 15 from the following site: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
