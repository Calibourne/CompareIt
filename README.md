This is a simple program that checks the content of 2 files
and displays whether they are identical or not.

Please note that there are 2 instances of the program:
1) An .exe instance (in the release folder) that is made with c# windows forms.
   Only compatible with windows os.
2) A .jar instance that is made with java.swing library.
  Compatible with either windows or mac os.

Special thanks to Amiga Yossy, Labai Lanna and Shamout Omar for testing the programs

Aditional thanks to Labai Lanna for providing the guide for starting the .jar file on mac computers
